 * Name: shmat
 *
 * Description:
 *   The shmat() function attaches the shared memory segment associated with
 *   the shared memory identifier specified by shmid to the address space of
 *   the calling process. The segment is attached at the address specified
 *   by one of the following criteria:
 *
 *     - If shmaddr is a null pointer, the segment is attached at the first
 *       available address as selected by the system.
 *     - If shmaddr is not a null pointer and (shmflg & SHM_RND) is non-
 *       zero, the segment is attached at the address given by
 *       (shmaddr - ((uintptr_t)shmaddr % SHMLBA)).
 *     - If shmaddr is not a null pointer and (shmflg & SHM_RND) is 0, the
 *       segment is attached at the address given by shmaddr.
 *     - The segment is attached for reading if (shmflg & SHM_RDONLY) is
 *       non-zero and the calling process has read permission; otherwise, if
 *       it is 0 and the calling process has read and write permission, the
 *       segment is attached for reading and writing.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   shmid  - Shared memory identifier
 *   smaddr - Determines mapping of the shared memory region
 *   shmflg - See SHM_* definitions in include/sys/shm.h.  Only SHM_RDONLY
 *            and SHM_RND are supported.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Upon successful completion, shmat() will increment the value of
 *   shm_nattch in the data structure associated with the shared memory ID
 *   of the attached shared memory segment and return the segment's start
 *   address.
 *
 *   Otherwise, the shared memory segment will not be attached, shmat() will
 *   return -1, and errno will be set to indicate the error.
 *
 *     - EACCES
 *       Operation permission is denied to the calling process
 *     - EINVAL
 *       The value of shmid is not a valid shared memory identifier, the
 *       shmaddr is not a null pointer, and the value of
 *       (shmaddr -((uintptr_t)shmaddr % SHMLBA)) is an illegal address for
 *       attaching shared memory; or the shmaddr is not a null pointer,
 *       (shmflg & SHM_RND) is 0, and the value of shmaddr is an illegal
 *       address for attaching shared memory.
 *     - EMFILE
 *       The number of shared memory segments attached to the calling
 *       process would exceed the system-imposed limit.
 *     - ENOMEM
 *       The available data space is not large enough to accommodate the
 *       shared memory segment.
